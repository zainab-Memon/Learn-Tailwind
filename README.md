# Learn-Tailwind
- Tailwind CSS makes it quicker to write and maintain the code of your application. 
- By using this utility-first framework, you don't have to write custom CSS to style your application. 
- Instead, you can use utility classes to control the padding, margin, color, font, shadow, and more of your application.
- The simplest and fastest way to get up and running with Tailwind CSS from scratch is with the Tailwind CLI tool. The CLI is also available as a standalone executable if you want to use it without installing Node.js.
